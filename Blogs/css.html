        <h1>How CSS Makes Your Website Look Better</h1>
        <p class="1">If you have ever visited a website that looks colorful, clean, and well-organized, you were
            actually looking at the power of CSS in action. When you create a website using only HTML, it works — but it
            looks very plain and boring. That’s where CSS comes in.

            In this article, we will learn what CSS is, why it is important, and how it helps make websites more
            attractive and user-friendly. We’ll keep things simple and easy to understand. Let’s get started!</p>
        <h2>What is CSS?</h2>
        <p class="2">CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is the language used to style HTML content on a web page.

            While HTML gives structure to a webpage (like text, headings, images, and buttons), CSS makes all of these
            elements look beautiful and neat.
