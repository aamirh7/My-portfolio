        <h1>What is JavaScript and What Can It Do?</h1>
        <p class="1">If youâ€™ve ever clicked a button on a website and something happened â€” like a popup, a dropdown
            menu, or a slideshow â€” youâ€™ve seen JavaScript in action.

            In this article, weâ€™ll learn what JavaScript is, why itâ€™s so important in web development, and what amazing
            things it can do to make your websites interactive and smart. Weâ€™ll keep everything simple and easy to
            follow, even if youâ€™re just starting out. Letâ€™s dive in!</p>
        <h2>What is JavaScript?</h2>
        <p class="2">JavaScript (often shortened to JS) is a programming language that makes web pages interactive.

            HTML builds the structure of the web page.
            CSS styles the web page (colors, fonts, layout).
            JavaScript brings the page to life.

            Hereâ€™s a simple way to think of it:

            HTML is the skeleton ðŸ¦´
            CSS is the skin and clothes ðŸ‘•
            JavaScript is the brain ðŸ§ 

            Without JavaScript, a website is just a static page. With JavaScript, it can move, react, and interact with
            users.
