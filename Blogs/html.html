            <h1>What is HTML and Why Do We Use It?</h1>
            <p class="1">When you open any website on your computer or phone, have you ever wondered how it was made?
                What is the basic building block of a website? The answer is HTML.

                In this blog, we will understand what HTML is, why it is important, and how it is used to create web
                pages. Don’t worry — we will keep everything simple and easy to understand. Let’s begin!</p>
            <h2>What is HTML?</h2>
            <p class="2">HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language. It is the standard language used to create the
                structure of a web page.

                Think of HTML as the skeleton of a website. Just like a human body needs a skeleton to hold everything
                together, a website needs HTML to arrange text, images, buttons, and other content on the screen.

                For example, when you see:

                A heading

                A paragraph

                An image

                A link

                A button

                All of these things are created using HTML.

            </p>
            <h2> HTML is Not a Programming Language</h2>
            <p class="3">HTML is not a programming language like JavaScript or Python. It does not have logic like "if"
                or "else". Instead, it is a markup language. This means it is used to mark or label content so that the
                browser (like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari) knows how to display it.</p>
            <h2> Why Do We Use HTML?</h2>
            <p class="4">HTML is used for many reasons. Here are some of the most important ones:

                1. To Create Web Pages
                Without HTML, we cannot create any website. It gives structure to your web page. Everything you see on a
                website — from headings to forms — starts with HTML.

                2. To Organize Content
                HTML allows you to organize your content in a proper format. You can add headings, lists, tables, links,
                images, and more.

                3. To Connect With CSS and JavaScript
                HTML works with CSS (for styling) and JavaScript (for interactivity). Together, they make modern
                websites possible.

                For example:

                HTML adds a button.

                CSS styles the button (color, size, etc.).

                JavaScript adds action to the button (like showing an alert or submitting a form).</p>
